# Purpose

Generate a Sitemap XML file in the syntax defined by [http://www.sitemaps.org/](http://www.sitemaps.org/).

# How to Use

In order to use this feature, you must have a "home page" page component, e.g. `geometrixx/components/homepage`. Once you have determined the resource type for this page component, configure a new instance of the `com.adobe.acs.commons.wcm.impl.SiteMapServlet` servlet with the resource type and, optionally, a domain name configured in the Externalizer component.

![sitemap servlet configuration]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/sitemap/config.png)

> See [http://dev.day.com/docs/en/cq/current/developing/externalizer.html](http://dev.day.com/docs/en/cq/current/developing/externalizer.html) for more information on configuring the Externalizer.

Once this is configured, the site map can be generated by requesting a page of the configured resource type with the selector `sitemap` and the extension `xml`. The sitemap will contain the current page and all descendent pages, skipping pages which have the "Hide in Nav" flag enabled.

Typically, you will also want to use either Resource Resolver Mappings or mod_rewrite rules in Apache to make the sitemap available the path `sitemap.xml` at the root of your domain.
