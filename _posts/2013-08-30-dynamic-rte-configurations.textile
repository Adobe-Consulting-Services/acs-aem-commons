h2. Purpose

A common challenge we run into on complex projects is where multiple business units within a company want to use the
same component, but with different rich text editor configurations. For example, let's say you have a simple text component used on two sites:

* SiteA - @/content/sitea@
* SiteB - @/content/siteb@

On SiteA, the text component should include the default plugins. On SiteB, the same component has the default plugins **plus** the special characters plugin.

Using dynamic RTE configuration, this can be done without creating extra components. This also allows for the easy sharing of RTE configurations within a site. If @/apps/myco/components/content/text@ and @/apps/myco/components/content/other-text@ need to share the same RTE configuration, that can be easily done by using a named configuration. This is *even* true if @text@ and @other-text@ use different property names, something that is very challenging with @cqinclude@.

h2. How to Use

# Create a node structure under @/etc/rteconfig@. Each node directly under @/etc/rteconfig@ defines a set of configurations, most commonly associated with a site. For the example above, you would have @/etc/rteconfig/sitea@ and @/etc/rteconfig/siteb@.
# On these site nodes, set a @pattern@ property with a regex defining when the rules within that node are applied, e.g. @/etc/rteconfig/sitea@ would have a @pattern@ of @/content/sitea/.*@
# Within the site nodes, create a node for each RTE configuration for that site. There is a special configuration name @default@ which will be the default name.

{% highlight json %}
{
    "sitea" : {
        "pattern" : "/content/sitea/.*",
        "default" : {
            "includeDefault" : true
        }
    },
    "siteb" : {
        "pattern" : "/content/siteb/.*",
        "default" : {
            "includeDefault" : true,
            "misctools" : {
                "features": [ "specialchars" ]
            }
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

#_ In your component, instead of an @richtext@ widget, use the xtype @slingscriptinclude@ and the script name @rte.<config-name>.<field-name>.json.jsp@. If the config name is not specified, "default" is used. If the field name is not specified, then "text" is used.

bq. NOTE: When the @includeDefault@ property is set to @true@, the configuration is layered on top of @/libs/foundation/components/text/dialog/items/tab1/items/text/rtePlugins@.

h3. Widget Customization (Since 1.2.2)

The Rich Text widgets provided by this configuration mechanism are, by default, very plain. Other than @rtePlugins@, only the following configuration options are set:

* @width@ - set to 430
* @height@ - set to 316
* @hideLabel@ - set to true

If you want to alter the configuration, this is done through passing query parameters. However, due to the way the @slingscriptinclude@ xtype works, you need to add an extension *after* the query parameter. If a @fieldLabel@ parameter is passed, the @hideLabel@ option will be automatically removed. See examples below.

h3. Examples

h4. To load the "press" configuration:
{% highlight json %}
{
    "jcr:primaryType" : "cq:Widget",
    "xtype" : "slingscriptinclude",
    "script" : "rte.press.json.jsp"
}
{% endhighlight %}

h4. To load the "default" configuration for a field named "text2"
{% highlight json %}
{
    "jcr:primaryType" : "cq:Widget",
    "xtype" : "slingscriptinclude",
    "script" : "rte.default.text2.json.jsp"
}
{% endhighlight %}

h4. To load the "default" configuration for a field named "text" with a field label "Text"
{% highlight json %}
{
    "jcr:primaryType" : "cq:Widget",
    "xtype" : "slingscriptinclude",
    "script" : "rte.default.text.json?fieldLabel=Text.jsp"
}
{% endhighlight %}


h4. To load the "default" configuration for a field named "text" with a custom stylesheet.
{% highlight json %}
{
    "jcr:primaryType" : "cq:Widget",
    "xtype" : "slingscriptinclude",
    "script" : "rte.default.text.json?externalStyleSheets=/etc/clientlibs/myco/source/mine.css.jsp"
}
{% endhighlight %}
