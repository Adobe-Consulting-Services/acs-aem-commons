## Purpose

Provide easy access to the Twitter API using configuration defined in an AEM Cloud Service.

## Dependencies

This feature depends upon the [Twitter4J](http://twitter4j.org/) API, version 3.0.5 or higher. You can download a content package with an OSGi bundle of this library from [here](https://github.com/Adobe-Consulting-Services/com.adobe.acs.bundles.twitter4j/releases/tag/com.adobe.acs.bundles.twitter4j-1.0.0).

## How to Use

To use this library, configure a Twitter Cloud Service in AEM and associate it with your site. See [AEM Documentation](http://bit.ly/1i3px4i) for details.

> Note - this feature does **not** depend upon the use of AEM's Social Login features. The Twitter Connect cloud service is only used for configuration.

Once you've configured the Twitter application credentials and associated it with your site, you can obtain an instance of the Twitter4J client by adapting a `Page` to either the Twitter4J `Twitter` class or `com.adobe.acs.commons.twitter.TwitterClient`. The former allows access to the `Twitter` client object as well as the `com.day.cq.wcm.webservicesupport.Configuration` object from which the client was created.

> Note - The resulting client uses "Application-Only Authentication" which limits which API methods can be called, although the rate limit for the methods which *can* be called is must higher. See [Twitter's documentation](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/application-only-auth) for more information.

For example:

{% highlight java %}
Twitter twitter = currentPage.adaptTo(Twitter.class);
{% endhighlight %}

or

{% highlight java %}   
TwitterClient client = currentPage.adaptTo(Twitter.class);
Twitter twitter = client.getTwitter();
{% endhighlight %}

If you have an instance of the `com.day.cq.wcm.webservicesupport.Configuration`, you can adapt that as well.

{% highlight java %}
Twitter twitter = adapterManager.getAdapter(configuration, Twitter.class);
{% endhighlight %}

## Rate Limit Checker

As both a useful utility and a demonstration of the use of the Twitter4J API, this feature also includes a page which outputs the current rate limit status for each configured Twitter Cloud Service Configuration. To view this, go to http://HOST:PORT/etc/acs-commons/twitter-rate-limit-checker.html.
