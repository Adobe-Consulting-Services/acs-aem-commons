## Purpose

Allow AEM authors (or "super authors") to flush parts of the dispatcher cache manually without the invovlement of IT Operations.

## How to Use

* Log in to AEM Author
* Navigate to Tools
* Create a folder named `acs-commons` (Title can be anything)
* Under the `acs-commmons` folder, create a folder named "dispatcher-flush" (Title can be anything)
* Under the `dispatcher-flush` folder, create a new Page of Template type "Dispatcher Flush"
	* Note: After v1.2.0, Dispatcher Flush templates creation will be limited to:
		* /etc/acs-commons/dispatcher-flush
		* /etc/dispatcher-flush
		* /etc/replication

* Give the page a logical naming ("Brand X Site" or "Brand Y Site")
* Open the page and edit the component

	* Add all the paths you would like to flush for the particular site
	* Select the "flush type"
	  * `Invalidate Cache` touches .stat files invalidating the cache
	  * `Delete Cache` deletes the files from Dispatcher
* Verify that all the expected Dispatcher Flush Agents are listed below the configuration and the paths are correct.

* Press the "Flush Paths" button
	* If the "Flush Paths" button does not appear something is wrong with the configuration or no Flush Agents are available.
* The page will refresh indicating the successful status of your Flush request
* If there are problems, review the Dispatcher Flush Agent Logs
      

**Note: This requires Dispatcher Flush Replication Agents to be setup on Author. If your Dispatcher Flush agents reside on Publish, you will need to setup a parrallel set on AEM Author with the setting if "Ignore Default"**
