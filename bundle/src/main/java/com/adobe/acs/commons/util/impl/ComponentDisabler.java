/**
 * Component disabler service
 * 
 * In Apache Felix the state of components and services is not persisted across restarts of its containing bundle.
 * For example, when you have a Bundle S containing a service S, and you manually stop the service S; after a
 * deactivate and activate of the bundle the service S is up again.
 * 
 * This service allows you to specify the names of components, which shouldn't be running. Whenever an OSGI service event is
 * fired, which services checks the status of this components and stops them if required.
 * 
 * Note 1: The component is always started, but this service takes care, that it is stopped immediately after. So if a behaviour
 * you don't like already happens during the activation of this service, you cannot prevent it using the mechanism here.
 * 
 * Note 2: Using this service should always be considered as a workaround. The primary focus should be to fix the component
 * you want to disable, so it's no longer required to disable it. If this component is part of Adobe AEM please raise a Daycare 
 * ticket for it.
