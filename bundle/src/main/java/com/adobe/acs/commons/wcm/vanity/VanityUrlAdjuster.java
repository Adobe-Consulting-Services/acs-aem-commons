 * This service interface provides a hook into the VanityUrlService, and allow for further adjustment of the

 * <br>
 * <br>For example, by convention a multi-tenant website might namespace sling:vanityPath properties with the tenant name;
 * <br>
 * <br>/content/tenant-a/section/page/jcr:content/@slingVanityPath=tenant-a__super-sale
 * <br>/content/tenant-b/section/page/jcr:content/@slingVanityPath=tenant-b__super-sale
 * <br>
 * <br>with www.tenant-a.com mapped to /content/tenant-a/
 * <br>with www.tenant-b.com mapped to /content/tenant-b/
 * <br>
 * <br>and www.tenant-a.com/super-sale resolving to /content/tenant-a/section/page
 * <br>and www.tenant-b.com/super-sale resolving to /content/tenant-b/section/page
 * <br>
 * <br>an impl of this, could look at the the domain attribute of the request,
 * <br>
 * <br>public String adjust(SlingHttpServletRequest request, String vanityUrl) {
 * <br>
 * <br>  // Trim leading slash so we can prefix w/ something...
