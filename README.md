This project is a unified collection of AEM/CQ code generated by the AEM consulting practice.

## Building

This project uses Maven for building. Common commands:

From the root directory, run `mvn -PautoInstallPackage clean install` (for AEM 6.5) or `mvn -PautoInstallPackage,cloud clean install` (for AEMaaCS) to build the bundles and content packages and install the container package to an AEM instance.

From the bundle directory, run `mvn -PautoInstallBundle clean install` to build *just* the bundle and install to an AEM instance. In addition there is the profile `autoInstallUiAppsPackage` to just install the `ui.apps` package to AEM.

The Maven profile `cloud` is used to both build both the AEMaaCS and the AEM 6.5 packages/bundles as well as to optionally install the version targeted for AEMaaCS (with the additional profile `autoInstallPackage` or `autoInstallUiPackage`). It is automatically active when no other profile is activated via command line or `settings,.xml`. 

To build only the version for AEM 6.5 (without using any other profiles) use the command line option `-P \!cloud` [to deactivate the default profile `cloud`](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-profiles.html#deactivating-a-profile).

## Using with VLT

To use vlt with this project, first build and install the package to your local AEM instance as described above. Then cd to `content/src/main/content/jcr_root` and run

    vlt --credentials admin:admin checkout -f ../META-INF/vault/filter.xml --force http://localhost:4502/crx

Once the working copy is created, you can use the normal ``vlt up`` and ``vlt ci`` commands.

## Specifying AEM Host/Port

The AEM host and port can be specified on the command line with:
mvn -Dcrx.host=otherhost -Dcrx.port=5502 <goals>
